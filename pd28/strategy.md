# Strategy

![Strategy Diagram](/files/strategy.png)

The project’s strategy integrates multiple data sources and statistical approaches in a unified framework.  
Results derived from **observational datasets**, **reanalysis products**, and **CMIP model simulations** are compared and synthesized to identify robust and consistent associations between external forcing (anthropogenic and natural) and the observed patterns of cloud cover and sea ice concentration.  

This multi-step approach ensures that the identified “climatic footprints” are not artifacts of a single dataset or method, but instead reflect physically consistent and reproducible drivers of variability.
