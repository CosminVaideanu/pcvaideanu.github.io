# 🧭 Project Strategy

![Strategy Diagram](/pd28/images/strategy.png)

The **PD28 / *Climatic Footprints*** project followed a **multi-step, integrative strategy** designed to ensure robust and reproducible results.  

---

## 🔄 Integrated Data & Methods

The approach combines:

- **Observational Datasets:** Satellite-derived records of sea ice concentration and cloud cover  
- **Reanalysis Products:** State-of-the-art atmospheric and oceanic reanalysis datasets (e.g., ERA5)  
- **Climate Model Simulations:** Historical and pre-industrial control runs from CMIP6 and AWI-ESM2.1  

These data sources were analyzed using **advanced statistical tools** — EOF, CCA, composite analysis, and CCM — to disentangle anthropogenic and natural signals.

---

## 🎯 Ensuring Robustness

By comparing results across **multiple datasets and methodologies**, the project ensures that the identified **“climatic footprints”** are:

- **Physically consistent** – aligned with known climate dynamics  
- **Reproducible** – appearing across independent datasets  
- **Robust** – not artifacts of a single method or dataset  

This strategy builds confidence in the attribution of observed changes to their underlying drivers.
