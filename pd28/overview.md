# Project Overview

Understanding the causes and impacts of climate change remains one of the most important scientific challenges of our time, with profound societal and policy implications. Despite progress in climate modeling, substantial uncertainties persist in projections of global cloud and sea ice cover, two of the most sensitive components of the climate system. Clouds can either amplify or dampen global warming depending on their type and location, while sea ice loss or gain strongly alters Earthâ€™s radiative balance through powerful feedbacks.  

Robustly separating the human-driven (anthropogenic) and naturally occurring contributions to observed climate variability is therefore essential for improving future climate projections. Modern day global climate models (e.g. CMIP5/CMIP6) exhibit large spread in cloud feedbacks and polar sea ice trends, limiting confidence in future projections. This project addresses these challenges by investigating the observed large-scale variability of clouds and sea ice and their response to external forcing and internal climate oscillations. By combining satellite observations, state-of-the-art reanalysis products, and climate model simulations, the project applies advanced statistical techniques to disentangle the human influence from natural internal variability, offering a clearer picture of the drivers shaping global clouds and sea ice variability over recent decades.
