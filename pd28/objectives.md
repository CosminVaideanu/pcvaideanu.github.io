# üéØ Project Objectives

The **primary goal** of the **PD28 / *Climatic Footprints*** project was to **separate anthropogenic (human-driven) and natural contributions** to observed variability in two of the most sensitive components of the climate system ‚Äî **clouds** and **sea ice**.  

The **secondary goal** was to **build an observational reference framework** that serves as a benchmark for climate model simulations, helping evaluate:
- The ability of models to reproduce observed spatial patterns  
- The timing and evolution of key signals  
- The relative strength of anthropogenic and natural forcing factors

## üîë Research Steps

The objectives were achieved through a **three-stage research strategy**, aligned with the original project proposal:

- **Stage 1 ‚Äì Data Diagnosis:**  
  Comprehensive evaluation of observed, reanalysis, and climate model datasets for global cloud cover and sea ice concentration.  

- **Stage 2 ‚Äì Detection & Attribution:**  
  Identification of anthropogenic and natural ‚Äúfootprints‚Äù in:
  - Observed cloud cover and sea ice concentration  
  - Reanalysis-based cloud cover and sea ice concentration  

- **Stage 3 ‚Äì Model Evaluation & Synthesis:**  
  - Identification of footprints in AWI-ESM2.1 simulations  
  - Comparison across observations, reanalysis, and model results  
  - Synthesis of findings into a coherent attribution framework  

</div>

Together, these steps provide a **robust attribution** of observed variability in clouds and sea ice to their underlying **drivers**.
