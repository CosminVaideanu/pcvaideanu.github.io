# Objectives

The **primary goal** of the PD28 / *Climatic Footprints* project was to distinguish between anthropogenic (human-driven) and natural contributions to observed variability in two of the most sensitive components of the climate system — clouds and sea ice.  

A **secondary goal** was to create an observational reference framework that can be used as a benchmark for climate model simulations, evaluating their ability to reproduce the spatial patterns, temporal evolution, and the relative contributions of key forcing factors.

## Research Steps

The objectives were achieved through a series of steps, aligned with the original project proposal:

- **Stage 1:** Diagnosis of observed, reanalysis, and model datasets for global cloud and sea ice cover.  
- **Stage 2:** Identification of anthropogenic and natural “footprints” in:
  - Observed cloud cover and sea ice concentration  
  - Reanalysis-based cloud cover and sea ice concentration  
- **Stage 3:**  
  - Identification of anthropogenic and natural footprints in the AWI-ESM2.1 climate model simulations  
  - Extensive comparison and synthesis of all results  

Together, these steps provided a robust basis for attributing observed variability in clouds and sea ice to their respective drivers.
