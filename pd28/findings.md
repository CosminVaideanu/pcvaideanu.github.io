# Key Findings

The **PD28 / *Climatic Footprints*** project delivered several major contributions to understanding the interplay between anthropogenic climate change and natural variability.  
Below are the three most important findings, each linked to its corresponding publication.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Anthropogenic Warming Dominates Arctic Sea Ice Variability

Our analysis shows that the **long-term decline in Arctic sea ice** is primarily driven by **human-induced warming**, with natural variability playing a secondary, modulating role.  
This finding demonstrates that Arctic sea ice loss cannot be explained by internal variability alone.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ AMOC Generates a Dipolar Sea Ice Pattern

We identified a **strong connection between Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) variability** and a **dipolar sea ice response**, featuring opposite anomalies in the Arctic and Antarctic.  
This emphasizes AMOC‚Äôs role in shaping interhemispheric climate variability and could improve predictability of polar climate change.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Pacific Climate Modes Drive Global Total Cloud Cover Variability

Pacific climate modes such as **ENSO (El Ni√±o‚ÄìSouthern Oscillation)** emerged as the leading drivers of **global total cloud cover variability**, while anthropogenic warming provides a significant but secondary influence.  
This result helps reduce uncertainty about cloud feedbacks in future climate projections.
