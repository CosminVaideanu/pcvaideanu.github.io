# Key Findings

The **PD28 / *Climatic Footprints*** project delivered several major contributions to understanding the interplay between anthropogenic climate change and natural variability.  
Here are the three most important findings:

---

### 1. Anthropogenic Warming Dominates Arctic Sea Ice Variability
Our results show that the long-term decline in Arctic sea ice is primarily driven by human-induced warming, with natural variability mainly modulating its influence. This robustly demonstrates that Arctic sea ice loss cannot be attributed to internal variability alone.

### 2. Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) Generates a Dipolar Sea Ice Pattern
We identified a strong link between AMOC variability and a dipolar sea ice response, with opposite anomalies in the Arctic and Antarctic. This highlights AMOCâ€™s role in shaping interhemispheric climate variability and improving potential predictability of polar changes.

### 3. Pacific Climate Modes Dominate Global Total Cloud Cover Variability
We found that Pacific climate modes such as ENSO are the leading drivers of total cloud cover variability, with anthropogenic warming playing a secondary but significant role. This finding reduces uncertainty about cloud feedbacks in climate projections.
