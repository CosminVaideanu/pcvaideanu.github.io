# Methods

The PD28 / Climatic Footprints project used a combination of observational datasets, reanalysis products, and climate model simulations to investigate the drivers of variability in clouds and sea ice. The analysis focused on separating human-driven (anthropogenic) signals from naturally occurring internal variability.

## Data

**Figure:** Overview of the main datasets used in the project, including satellite-derived sea ice records, reanalysis-based cloud and climate variables, and CMIP6 climate model experiments.

The study relied on:
- **Satellite observations:** Sea ice concentration records from passive microwave sensors.  
- **Reanalysis products:** ERA5 for cloud cover, surface air temperature, and atmospheric circulation fields.  
- **Model simulations:** CMIP6 historical and pre-industrial control simulations for externally forced and internal variability components.

## Methods

To isolate anthropogenic and natural contributions to variability, the project applied several advanced techniques:

- **Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) Analysis:** Identified dominant spatial patterns of variability in cloud and sea ice cover.  
- **Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA):** Quantified covariability between global sea surface temperature anomalies and polar cloud/sea ice fields.  
- **Composite Analysis:** Examined typical atmospheric patterns during periods of extreme sea ice loss or gain.  
- **Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM):** Assessed causal links between climate modes (e.g., AMO, IPO) and cloud or sea ice variability.  

Together, these methods allowed the project to separate forced responses from natural variability and to attribute observed changes to specific drivers.
