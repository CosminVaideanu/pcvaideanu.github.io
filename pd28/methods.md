# Methods

The **PD28 / Climatic Footprints** project combined **observational datasets, reanalysis products, and climate model simulations** to investigate the drivers of variability in clouds and sea ice.  
Our goal was to separate **human-driven (anthropogenic) signals** from **naturally occurring internal variability**.

### Main Data Sources
- üì° **Satellite Observations:** Passive microwave records for sea ice concentration.  
- üìä **Reanalysis Products:** ERA5 for cloud cover, surface air temperature, and circulation fields.  
- üåç **Climate Model Simulations:** CMIP6 historical & pre-industrial control runs to separate forced vs. internal variability.

## üî¨ Analytical Methods

We applied a suite of advanced techniques to extract signals and attribute variability:

- **Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) Analysis**  
  Extracted leading spatial patterns of cloud and sea ice variability, improving signal-to-noise ratio.

- **Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)**  
  Linked global SST anomalies with polar cloud/sea ice fields to reveal coupled climate modes.

- **Composite Analysis**  
  Characterized atmospheric circulation patterns during periods of extreme sea ice gain/loss.

- **Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM)**  
  Tested causality between climate modes (e.g., AMO, IPO) and cloud/sea ice variability.

Together, these methods provided a robust separation of **forced responses** from **natural climate variability**, allowing for a clearer attribution of observed changes.
