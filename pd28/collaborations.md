## üåä Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI)

Collaboration with the [**Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Center for Polar and Marine Research (AWI)**](https://www.awi.de/en.html) played a central role in the project.  
Through close cooperation with the [**Paleoclimate Dynamics Group**](https://www.awi.de/en/science/climate-sciences/paleoclimate-dynamics.html), we jointly analyzed **AWI-ESM2.1** simulations, leading to robust insights into coupled **SST‚Äìsea ice variability** under historical climate forcing.

## üß† HIDA ‚Äì Helmholtz Information & Data Science Academy

Two research visits to AWI were financed through [**HIDA (Helmholtz Information & Data Science Academy)**](https://www.helmholtz-hida.de/en/).  
These visits facilitated:
- Hands-on access to AWI climate model data  
- Advanced training in statistical analysis  
- Strengthened knowledge exchange with international experts
