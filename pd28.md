### About the Project

The **PD28/2022 – "Climatic Footprints"** project investigated the interplay between anthropogenic climate change and natural climate variability, focusing on their specific contributions in **observed patterns of planetary sea ice and cloud cover variability**.  

All project objectives were successfully achieved in accordance with the original research plan. Results were disseminated through **five scientific papers published** — three as main author, one as second author, and one as third author — in ISI-indexed journals, with impact factor ranging from ~2 to ~4.  

The project also fostered strong international collaboration with the **Alfred Wegner Institute Helmholtz Center for Polar and Marine Research (AWI), Bremerhaven, Germany**, one of Europe’s leading climate research centers. This collaboration included two research visits funded by the **Helmholtz Information and Data Science Academy (HIDA)**, which facilitated in-depth discussions, knowledge exchange, and the joint analysis of model data (AWI-ESM2.1). These visits strengthened the scientific impact of the project and opened opportunities for future cooperation.
