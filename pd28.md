### About the Project
The PD28/2022, "Climatic Footprints" project, investigated the interplay between anthropogenic climate change and natural climate variability, focusing on their specific contributions in observed patterns of planetary sea ice and cloud cover variability. All project objectives were successfully achieved in accordance with the original research plan. Results were disseminated through five scientific papers published — three as main author, one as second author, and one as third author — in ISI-indexed journals, with impact factor ranging from ~2 to ~4.The project also fostered strong international collaboration with the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI), one of Europe’s leading climate research centers. This collaboration included two research visits funded by the Helmholtz Information and Data Science Academy (HIDA), which facilitated in-depth discussions, knowledge exchange, and the joint analysis of model data (AWI-ESM2.1). These visits strengthened the scientific impact of the project and opened opportunities for future cooperation.Project results were also presented at several national and international conferences, reaching both the scientific community and stakeholders interested in climate variability and change.
